### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Suhas Kudlur Viswanath and I am an avid enthusiast of open Instruction Set Architectures like RISC-V. I mainly develop RTL for processors using the RISC-V ISA, some more RTL for accelerators. I am working as a Hardware Engineer at Arithmic Labs working on the research and development of an accelerator on FPGA.
